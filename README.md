# Glyph
An [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script for typing diacritical characters (accent marks) on a QWERTY keyboard.

## How does it work?
This stand-alone tool is written in AutoHotkey v2. You can download and run the .exe file by itself, or view the whole code in the .ahk file, which can be run without the .exe [using AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/Tutorial.htm#s11).
